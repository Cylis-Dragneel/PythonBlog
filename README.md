### What This Is
This a fun test project to make a Blog Website using the django framework for python.

This is by no means a flashy or even a final product, but a proof of concept.

You can check out the website [here](cylis.pythonanywhere.com)

### What the future of this project will be
I might use the project to use it for what it was meant to be, a blog. So I might in the future come back and clean up the code, make the site prettier and more functional.

In the meanwhile you can go visit my about/portoflio page [here](https://cylis.is-a.dev). It contains my contact info as well as what other projects I have worked on or am working on.
